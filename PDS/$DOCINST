                          MC  (MOVE COPY a Dataset)

Installation
============
> Copy REXX MC to an EXEC dataset
> Copy Panel MCPAN1 to a panel library
> ASMLK TSOSMS (see sample JCL)
Make sure a TSO call to the ADRDSSU program is APF authorized.
  (This can be done by putting the name ADRDSSU into the
  AUTHPGM list in the IKJTSOxx member of PARMLIB.)
Logoff/Logon TSO

Execution
=========
* =3.4 any dataset HLQ
* MC line command any dataset you wish to move or copy
  -OR-
* "TSO MC yourdsnhere" (don't need =3.4 for this way)
* Fill in panel options as required. NOTE, you CANNOT RECATALOG
  an existing dataset when you COPY it (DFDSS restriction). You
  must MOVE it in order to recatalog.

Notes
=====
This REXX uses DFSMSdss to perform its operations. Upon
encountering any errors you will get a display of the error and
the input parms. Having a utility like QUIKREF is very handy in
quickly looking up the error msg.
